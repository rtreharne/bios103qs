## Task 1.

The image below represents an image captured by a digital microscope from a hemocytometer prepared using 100 &mu;L of initial cell suspension diluted with 100 &mu;L of Trypan blue.

Each white circle (with a black outline) represents a viable red blood cell. Each blue circle represents a non-viable cell.
