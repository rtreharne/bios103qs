# Mushroom Compost Data Analysis in R

## Introduction
In this exercise, we will visualize data from a mushroom composting dataset. The task involves creating summary statistics and visualizations using R. Each student will receive a unique dataset based on their student ID.

## Downloading the Dataset
1. **Go to** `www.canvaswizards.org.uk/compost`.
2. **Enter your Student ID** and click **I agree**.
3. **Download the dataset**. The file will be named `compost_<ID>.csv` where `<ID>` is your student ID.

## Setting Up RStudio
1. **Create a new project** in RStudio, named `U_compost`.
2. **Start a new script** file called `summary_table.R`.

## Reading the Data
```r
# Comment: Read data
data <- read.csv("compost_<ID>.csv")
```

## Creating Summary Statistics
1. **Install and load the dplyr package** if not already installed.
   ```r
   # Install dplyr if not installed
   install.packages("dplyr")
   
   # Load the library
   library(dplyr)
   ```

2. **Calculate Summary Statistics**
   ```r
   # Create summary statistics table
   summary_stats <- data %>%
     group_by(Location) %>%
     summarise(
       mean_temp = mean(Temperature, na.rm = TRUE),
       sd_temp = sd(Temperature, na.rm = TRUE),
       mean_moisture = mean(Moisture, na.rm = TRUE),
       sd_moisture = sd(Moisture, na.rm = TRUE),
       mean_vbc = mean(Viable.Counts * 2e5 / 1e7, na.rm = TRUE),
       sd_vbc = sd(Viable.Counts * 2e5 / 1e7, na.rm = TRUE)
     )
   
   # Print summary statistics
   print(summary_stats)
   ```

3. **Export Summary Statistics to CSV**
   ```r
   write.csv(summary_stats, "summary_stats.csv", row.names = FALSE)
   ```

## Data Visualization
Create basic visualizations using R:

1. **Histogram**
   ```r
   hist(data$Temperature, main="Temperature Distribution", xlab="Temperature", col="blue")
   ```

2. **Box Plot**
   ```r
   boxplot(data$Moisture ~ data$Location, main="Moisture by Location", xlab="Location", ylab="Moisture")
   ```

3. **Scatter Plot**
   ```r
   plot(data$Temperature, data$Viable.Counts, main="Temperature vs Viable Counts", xlab="Temperature", ylab="Viable Counts")
   ```

## Formatting and Submission
1. **Open the summary statistics CSV** in Excel and format it for a Word document.
2. **Include units** in your table for clarity (e.g., Temperature in Â°C, Moisture in %, VBC in CFU per gram).
3. **Add a caption** and define any abbreviations used in the table.

## Notes
- When quoting viable bacterial counts, use the format "x 10^7 CFU per gram".
- Always define abbreviations like TM (Temperature), M (Moisture), VBC (Viable Bacterial Count).

## Submission
Submit the Word document with tables and graphs as instructed on Canvas.
