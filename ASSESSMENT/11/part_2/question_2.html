    <h2>The Doomscroller Virus Pandemic: Part Two</h2>

    <p>
        New evidence has come to light that the viable red blood cell count is less
        important than the proportion of non-viable cells. In fact, any sample
        in which there are more than 20% non-viable can be interpreted as a positive test for the virus.

    <p>
        Problem. Your hemo-tools.R script only counts viable cells. You need to quickly update the script to 
        count non-viable cells and then use it to calculate the percentage of non-viable cells in a sample.
    </p>

    <p>
        You are given a ANOTHER
        <strong>
            <a href='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rtreharne/qs/main/data/11/hemo_100.zip'>
                zip file
            </a>
         containing 100 hemocytometer images
        </strong>, each representing a slide prepared from suspected infected blood 
        samples. Your task is to run the script on each image and count the number of positive
        results identified by a non-viable cell proportion that is greater than 20%. 
    </p>

    <h3>Instructions:</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Download the <a href='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rtreharne/qs/main/data/11/hemo_100.zip'>
            zip file
        </a> containing hemocytometer images and copy it to your project directory.</li>
        <li>Update the <a target='_blank' href='https://raw.githubusercontent.com/rtreharne/qs/main/script/11/hemo-tools.R'>hemo-tools.R</a> script using your R knowledge to extract the viable AND non-viable cell counts for each image in the zip file. Non-viable cells appear blue.</li>
        <li>Calculate the percentage of non-viable cells in each of the images.</li>
        <li>Report how many samples have a percentage of non-viable cells greater than 20% in the box below.</li>
    </ol>
