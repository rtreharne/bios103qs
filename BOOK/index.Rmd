# Preface {-}

This is a simple example of a book written in Markdown, intended to be compiled with `bookdown`.

This preface can introduce the reader to the book's objectives, structure, and how to navigate it. You can include any preliminary information that the reader should know before diving into the chapters.

The `{-}` next to the chapter title (here in the Preface) indicates to bookdown that this chapter should not be numbered.

## How to Use This Book

You might want to include a section on how the reader should use the book, what prerequisites they should have, or what additional resources might complement the book.

## Acknowledgements

Don't forget to acknowledge those who helped you in writing the book, whether it's through direct contributions, inspiration, or support.
